# Computer_Vision_and_Pattern_Recognition_Code
Repository where I try to use all the code seen in the lecture Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. This includes projects (solo/team).

## Zoom in - zoom out folder:
Contains code for basic transformations of an image: zoom and shrink an image.

## Transformation assignment:
This is the first assignment of the course: 
- Write a program that rotates a grayscale image about its centre, using the **decomposition of the rotation into a product of 3 shears**
- For the implementation of each of the three shears, use one-dimensional linear interpolation in the direction of the shear.
- Embed the rotated image at the centre of a canvas that is twice as wide and twice as high as the input. Fill any empty space of the image with a   default intensity of 255.

## Image correctors:
Since in the fourth lesson we saw intensity transformation like **gamma transformation** and **contrast streching** I've decided to create a small application that help users fix intensity of images. We the advancing of the lesson, this little project will be updated with the new function I will learn.
